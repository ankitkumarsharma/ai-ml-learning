# Gen AI

GenAI (short for Generative AI) is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new original content — such as text, images, code, videos, music, 3D models, voice, and more — instead of just analyzing or classifying existing data.
Think of traditional AI as a very good librarian who can quickly find, summarize or classify books.

Generative AI is more like a creative writer/artist who has read millions of books, looked at billions of pictures, listened to endless music — and now can write a new story, draw a new picture, or compose new music in a similar style.

## Everyday Examples of GenAI (as of 2026)

- ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Gemini → writing emails, code, stories, explanations
- Midjourney, DALL·E 3/4, Flux, Stable Diffusion → creating images from text descriptions
- Runway, Sora, Luma, Kling → generating & editing videos
- Suno, Udio, MusicGen → composing original songs
- GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Devin → writing computer code
- ElevenLabs, Voicebox → creating realistic voice cloning/speech

## Key points
- Any LLM create tokenization for each work or letter in numeric form of every input and in behalf of each numeric value take as input and compare or simlilarity for prediction and get back output to user. example - "Who are you ?", so here "who","are","you","?" will be in numeric form as per LLM rules like [2,3,5,1,23,5]
- LLM take input and predict that input with data and on their prediction of similarity or compare numeric input , gives output. only LLM dont have any logic or methods. It have only large numeric presentation set of data. If for any data asking by user, and LLM not trained for that, so it can't answer it without 3rd party tool.

## Context in GenAI
LLM input saved as context, In AI and LLMs (Large Language Models), context means the information the model uses to understand and generate responses correctly. It includes below list
- Your current message
- Previous messages in the conversation
- System instructions
- Any additional provided data

In AI and LLMs (Large Language Models), context means the information the model uses to understand and generate responses correctly.

Let’s break it down simply 👇

1️⃣ What is Context in an LLM?

In models like GPT-4 or ChatGPT, context refers to:

The text (input + conversation history) that the model can "see" at one time to generate a response.

It includes:

Your current message

Previous messages in the conversation

System instructions

Any additional provided data

2️⃣ Example to Understand
Without Context:

User: “What about its speed?”
The model doesn’t know what “its” refers to.

With Context:

User: “Tell me about the Tesla Model 3.”
User: “What about its speed?”

Now the model understands that “its” refers to Tesla Model 3.

That previous conversation = context.

3️⃣ Context Window

Every LLM has a context window, which is:

The maximum amount of text (tokens) the model can process at once.

For example:

Smaller models → smaller context window

Larger models → larger context window

If the conversation becomes too long:

Older messages may be removed

The model may "forget" earlier parts

4️⃣ Types of Context in AI
🔹 1. Immediate Context

The current conversation messages.

🔹 2. Long-Term Context (Memory)

Saved preferences or information across sessions (if enabled).

🔹 3. External Context

Data retrieved from:

Databases

APIs

Documents (RAG systems)

5️⃣ Why Context is Important

Context helps the model:

Understand references ("he", "it", "that")

Maintain conversation flow

Personalize responses

Stay consistent

Perform complex reasoning

6️⃣ Technical View (Simple Version)

LLMs like GPT work using:

Tokens (small pieces of text)

Attention mechanism

The attention mechanism allows the model to:

Look at all relevant tokens in the context and decide what matters most.

That’s how it maintains understanding across a conversation.

In One Line:

👉 Context in LLM = All the information the model can see and use to generate its current response.
